// The sort order here is important for two reasons:
//  1. The compiled CSS needs to be logically ordered/grouped (NOT alphabetically ordered)
//  2. Selectors of equal weight get applied based on which appears last in the stylesheet,
//     so we should try not to change this order once it is in place
